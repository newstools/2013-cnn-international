(CNN)Here's a look at listeriosis, a serious infection generally caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. 2001 - Listeriosis (infection with L. monocytogenes) is added to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) list of nationally notifiable diseases. General Information According to the CDC, 928 cases of listeriosis were reported in the United States in 2019. Typically, Listeriosis affects older adults, pregnant women, infants and adults with compromised immune systems. Pregnant women are approximately 10 times more likely to get listeriosis. Pregnant Hispanic women are 24 times more likely to get listeriosis than other people. Listeria is named after Dr. Joseph Lister, an English surgeon who introduced sterilization into surgery. The mouthwash Listerine is also named after Dr. Lister. Symptoms and Treatment Symptoms include fever and muscle aches, and sometimes diarrhea or other gastrointestinal problems. Other symptoms are headache, confusion and convulsions. Almost everyone diagnosed with listeriosis has an infection that has spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract. Infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery or infection of the newborn. Listeriosis can be treated with antibiotics. Prevention General recommendations:Thoroughly cook meat. Clean raw fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating. Keep uncooked meats and poultry separate from vegetables and from cooked foods. Do not drink unpasteurized milk or eat foods that contain unpasteurized milk. Wash hands, utensils and countertops after handling uncooked foods. Recommendations for persons at high risk:  Do not eat hot dogs, cold cuts, other deli meats, or fermented or dry sausages unless they are cooked properly. Do not eat refrigerated meat spreads and pâtés.Do not eat soft cheese unless it is labeled as made with pasteurized milk.
