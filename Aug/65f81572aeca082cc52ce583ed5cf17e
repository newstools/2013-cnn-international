(CNN)Here's a look at the 2001 anthrax attacks, also referred to as Amerithrax. Facts about anthrax There are three types of anthrax infection: cutaneous (through the skin), inhalation (through the lungs; the most deadly) and gastrointestinal (through digestion). There has been a fourth type of anthrax identified as injection anthrax. This is common in heroin-injecting users in northern Europe. This has never been reported in the United States. It can be contracted by handling products from infected animals or by breathing in anthrax spores and by eating undercooked meat from infected animals. Anthrax has been blamed for several plagues over the ages that killed both humans and livestock. It emerged in World War I as a biological weapon. The CDC categorizes anthrax as a Category A agent: one that poses the greatest possible threat for a negative impact on public health; one that may spread across a large area or need public awareness and requires planning to protect the public's health.

Anthrax was sent via anonymous letters to news agencies in Florida and New York and a congressional office building in Washington. Of the five victims who died of inhalation anthrax, two were postal workers. The other three victims were an elderly woman from rural Connecticut, a Manhattan hospital worker from the Bronx and an employee at a Florida tabloid magazine who may have contracted anthrax through cross-contamination. The letters were sent to NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, Sen. Majority Leader Tom Daschle, Sen. Patrick Leahy, and the New York Post offices. The letters were postmarked Trenton, New Jersey. No arrests have been made in the attacks. The FBI has interviewed more than 10,000 people and issued more than 6,000 subpoenas in the case. 4.8 million masks and 88 million gloves were purchased by the Postal Service for its employees, and 300 postal facilities were tested for anthrax. Over 32,000 people took antibiotics after possible exposure to anthrax.
