(CNN)Here's a look at commercial passenger airplane crashes. For crashes caused by military acts or by terrorism, see Terrorism and War-Related Airplane Crashes Fast Facts. On August 12, 1985, the largest number of deaths in a single commercial airplane crash occurred when a Japan Air Lines Boeing 747 crashed into Mt. Ogura in Japan, killing 520 passengers and crew members. The deadliest commercial airplane accident occurred on March 27, 1977, when two Boeing 747s collided on a runway on the Spanish island of Tenerife, killing 583. Timeline December 14, 1920 - Believed to be one of the first known commercial passenger airplane crashes, a British Handley Page HP-16 en route to Paris from London crashes just after takeoff, killing four of the eight people onboard.

May 25, 1979 - An American Airlines DC-10 crashes after takeoff from Chicago O'Hare International Airport, killing 271 onboard and another two on the ground. During takeoff, an engine on the left wing falls off; the FAA later faults American Airlines maintenance techniques for the crash. November 28, 1979 - An Air New Zealand DC-10 crashes into Mt. Erebus in Antarctica and 257 people are killed. The crash is believed to be the result of a navigational error. August 19, 1980 - Shortly after takeoff, a Saudi Arabian Airlines Lockheed L-1011 initiates a return to Riyadh International Airport due to a fire in the aft cargo compartment.

April 28, 1988 - An Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 decompresses, causing an in-air explosion. The pilot manages to land the plane safely, but one person is killed and dozens of passengers and crew members are injured. Later, the NTSB faults the airline's maintenance program for failing to address signs of metal fatigue and disbonding which ultimately caused the fuselage separation. The Aviation Safety Research Act of 1988 is passed by Congress as a result of this incident.

October 31, 1999 - EgyptAir Flight 990, bound for Cairo from New York, crashes into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, plunging 14,000 feet in 36 seconds. All 203 passengers and 14 crew members are killed. The US National Transportation Safety Board determines the crash was the result of the co-pilot's actions, but is unable to pinpoint why.

March 10, 2019 - A Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashes in Ethiopia, killing all 157 people on aboard, marking the second time in less than six months that one of the planes has crashed within minutes of takeoff. Lion Air Boeing 737 Max 8 flight went down over the Java Sea last October, killing 189 people. Both crashes are under investigation, and there is no evidence of a link between the two, but similarities between the incidents have prompted caution among some aviation authorities and airlines. On April 4, 2019, according to Boeing, a preliminary report on the Boeing 737 MAX 8 crash in Ethiopia "contains flight data recorder information indicating the airplane had an erroneous angle of attack sensor input that activated the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) function during the flight, as it had during the Lion Air 610 flight."
