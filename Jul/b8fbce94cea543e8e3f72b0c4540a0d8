(CNN)Here's a look at Mad Cow Disease, a fatal brain disease found in cattle. Facts It has been linked to a fatal brain disease in humans called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). The official name of mad cow disease is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). BSE lesions are characterized by sponge-like changes seen under an ordinary microscope. Eating contaminated meat or other products from cattle (excluding dairy products) with BSE is thought to be the cause of vCJD. BSE is passed between cows through the practice of recycling bovine carcasses for meat and bone meal protein, which is fed back to other cattle. Both mad cow disease and vCJD are fatal. Symptoms of vCJD involve psychiatric symptoms and behavioral changes, movement deficits, memory disturbances and cognitive impairments.
