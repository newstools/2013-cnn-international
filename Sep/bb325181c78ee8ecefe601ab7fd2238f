(CNN)Here's a look at Guantánamo Bay Naval Station and its detention facilities. Facts The base, sometimes referred to as "Gitmo," is located in southeastern Cuba, on the coast of Guantánamo Bay. The United States has been leasing the 45 square miles that the base sits on since 1903. The base shares a 17-mile fenced border with Cuba. The lease can only be terminated by mutual agreement. Detention Facilities In response to the 9/11 attacks in 2001, and subsequent military operations in Afghanistan, existing migrant detention facilities at Guantánamo were repurposed to hold detainees in the "war on terror." During the administration of President George W. Bush (2001-2009), the United States claimed that Guantánamo Bay detainees were not on US soil and therefore not covered by the US Constitution, and that "enemy combatant" status meant they could be denied some legal protections. There are 38 detainees at Guantánamo Bay. More than 700 detainees have been held at Guantánamo since it opened. Peak population was 684 detainees in June 2003. According to Human Rights First, 500 detainees were transferred or released during the Bush Administration and 197 detainees were transferred or released during the Obama Administration. At least nine detainees have died in custody. The US Defense Department spent about $445 million to run Guantánamo Bay in 2015, down from $522.2 million in 2010.
