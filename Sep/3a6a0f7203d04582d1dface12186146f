(CNN)Here's a look at the United Nations Security Council, a 15-member body within the United Nations. Overview The Security Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Security Council has 15 members. There are five permanent members: the United States, the Russian Federation, France, China and the United Kingdom. Ten temporary members are elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms. UN Security Council Voting To be approved, a Council resolution must have nine "YES" votes out of 15 and no "NO" votes from any of the five permanent members. Each Council member has one vote. A "NO" vote from one of the five permanent members kills the resolution. There is no such thing as a "VETO" vote in formal UN rules, though a "NO" vote from a permanent member has the effect of vetoing a resolution. If a member "ABSTAINS" from voting, it does not count as either a "YES" or "NO" vote. Members raise their hands to vote, and sit at a horseshoe-shaped table. Each of the five Permanent Members has gone to war or invaded a country without Security Council approval.
