(CNN)Here's some background information about Mars exploration. The United States and the Soviet Union are the only two countries to land a spacecraft on Mars. Facts There have been nine successful US Mars landings: Viking 1 and Viking 2 (both 1976), Pathfinder (1997), Spirit and Opportunity (both 2004), Phoenix (2008), Curiosity (2012), InSight (2018) and Perseverance (2021). The only other country to land a spacecraft on Mars was the Soviet Union in 1971 and 1973. The United States, the Soviet Union, the European Space Agency and India have successfully sent spacecraft to enter Mars' orbit. Timeline 1965 - Mariner 4 passes within 6,000 miles (about 9,650 kilometers) of Mars and takes the first close-up photos of the planet's surface. 1969 - Mariners 6 and 7 passes within about 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers) of the planet and transmit information about the planet's surface and atmosphere. November 3, 1971 - Mariner 9 launches. It reaches orbit on November 24, becoming the first US spacecraft to orbit a planet other than Earth. December 2, 1971 - The USSR's Mars 3 lander makes the first successful landing on the planet's surface. It transmits data for 20 seconds before failing. July and August 1973 - The USSR successfully launches Mars 4, 5, 6 and 7. Each spacecraft takes about seven months to reach the planet's orbit.

February 2, 2004 - For the first time, both Spirit and Opportunity are fully operational. The rovers, 6,600 miles apart, collect soil samples and take photographs of the Martian surface. Both rovers find evidence of ancient Martian environments that were intermittently wet and habitable. August 12, 2005 - The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter launches. It will scan the planet for more signs of water. March 10, 2006 - The Reconnaissance Orbiter reaches Mars and establishes its orbit. It carries the most powerful camera ever to leave Earth, called HiRise. The camera takes its first four pictures on March 23, while the orbiter circles Mars at a distance of between 600 and 2,500 miles (900 to 4,000 kilometers). This initial phase of exploration lasts two weeks. January 24, 2007 - On the third anniversary of its landing, Opportunity continues its mission of exploring the Martian terrain -- 33 months longer than originally intended. August 4, 2007 - NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander is launched successfully. Its rocket launches at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida and takes about 10 months to reach Mars. Phoenix, part of NASA's Scout program for smaller and lower-cost spacecraft, is designed to analyze soil samples and scan the Martian atmosphere after landing near its northern pole. May 25, 2008 - The Mars Phoenix Lander completes a 296-day, 422-million-mile journey, landing near the planet's north pole. November 2008 - The Mars Phoenix Lander ceases communications after completing its mission. Originally expected to last 90 Martian solar days, the lander performs scientific investigations for 149 days of its 152-solar-day lifetime. March 22, 2010 - Last communication is heard from Spirit. The project continues to monitor for further communication. Opportunity is still operational. September 10, 2010 - Scientists release data from the Mars Phoenix Lander suggesting that water has been weathering Mars' surface throughout history.  Data also suggests that Mars' carbon dioxide atmosphere has been replenished by geologically recent volcanic eruptions providing evidence for what could be ongoing activity. April 6, 2011 - The rover nicknamed Curiosity is unveiled. It is far larger than Spirit and Opportunity, weighing approximately 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms) and about the size of a Mini Cooper car. May 25, 2011 - NASA scientists end attempts to regain contact with Spirit. November 26, 2011 - The Curiosity rover launches from Cape Canaveral at 10:02 a.m. ET, aboard an Atlas V rocket bound for Mars. The journey is scheduled to last approximately 8.5 months.
