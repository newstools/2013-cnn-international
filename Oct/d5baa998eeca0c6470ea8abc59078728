(CNN)Here's some background information about the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal which took place during the Iraq war. Facts Abu Ghraib prison was a US Army detention center for captured Iraqis from 2003 to 2006.

The abuses took place inside the prison in cell blocks 1A and 1B. Eleven US soldiers were convicted of crimes relating to the Abu Ghraib scandal.
