(CNN)Here's some background information about the London Underground, also known as "The Tube," the oldest subway or metro transit system in the world. Facts There are currently 270 stations open and 249 miles (402 km) of active lines. There are a number of old stations and tunnels that are now closed. In the 2019/2020 year, there were nearly 1.34 billion passenger journeys. Passenger journey totals in 2020/2021 have been significantly lower due to the coronavirus pandemic, with just over 296 million as of June 2021. The London Underground is patrolled by the British Transport Police (BTP). Some stations are under the jurisdiction of the BTP and local police agencies. Over 12,000 CCTV cameras are used to monitor the London Underground stations, depots, car parks and trains.
