Facts The Tour de France is a prestigious multistage bike race that takes place annually in France and sometimes the surrounding countries. The race, also known as Le Tour or La Grande Boucle, includes 21 stages and covers 3,328 kilometers in 2022. There have been four cyclists who have won the Tour five times:Jacques Anquetil of France (1957 and 1961-1964)Eddy Merckx of Belgium (1969-1972 and 1974)Bernard Hinault of France (1978-1979, 1981-1982, and 1985)Miguel Indurain of Spain (1991-1995), the first competitor to win five consecutive races. Lance Armstrong held the record for most Tour de France wins (seven), but he was stripped of those wins in 2012. France has won more times than any other country (36). Three Americans have won: Greg LeMond (1986, 1989, 1990), Armstrong (1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005) and Floyd Landis (2006). Both Armstrong and Landis have had their titles stripped due to allegations of doping. The winner of the race is the person with the overall shortest accumulated time. Ten, six and four second bonuses are awarded to the top three riders at the end of road stages, excluding the individual and team time trials. There are two rest days. Jerseys YELLOW -- "maillot jaune" -- Overall leader of the race. The yellow jersey was introduced into the race in 1919, most likely because the race's sponsor was a French newspaper (formerly L'Auto, now L'Equipe) that printed on distinctive yellow paper. POLKA DOT -- "maillot à pois rouge" -- Worn by the cyclist with the best accumulated time in the mountain segments. GREEN -- "maillot vert" -- Worn by the points classification leader. Points are awarded for intermediate and final sprints on flat terrain. WHITE -- "maillot blanc" -- Worn by the Tour's best rider aged 25 and younger.
